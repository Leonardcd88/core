Please add a meaningful title and a short description of your issue. It's hard to help you if you only add a trackback with no comments or a one-liner.

Add the following details to your report. Especially if you are unsure about that to include. 

- [ ] Your Home Assistant release, `hass --version`
- [ ] Your operating system 
- [ ] The component/platform involved
- [ ] The config entry for the component/platform from your `configuration.yml` file
- [ ] Your traceback

It helps if you use the formatting options provided by GitHub ;-)

Anyway, make sure that you have **searched** the closed issues first. Thanks!
