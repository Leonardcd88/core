custom_components.proximity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Component to monitor the proximity of devices to a particular zone and the
direction of travel. The result is an entity created in HA which maintains
the proximity data

This component is useful to reduce the number of automation rules required
when wanting to perform automations based on locations outside a particular
zone. The standard HA zone and state based triggers allow similar control
but the number of rules grows exponentially when factors such as direction
of travel need to be taken into account. Some examples of its use include:
- Increase thermostat temperature as you near home
- Decrease temperature the further away from home you travel

The Proximity entity which is created has the following values:
state = distance from the monitored zone (in km)
dir_of_travel = direction of the closest device to the monitoed zone. Values
                are:
                'not set'
                'arrived'
                'towards'
                'away_from'
                'unknown'
                'stationary'
dist_to_zone = distance from the monitored zone (in km)

Use configuration.yaml to enable the user to easily tune a number of settings:
- Zone: the zone to which this component is measuring the distance to. Default
  is the home zone
- Ignored Zones: where proximity is not calculated for a device (either the
  device being monitored or ones being compared (e.g. work or school)
- Devices: a list of devices to compare location against to check closeness to
  the configured zone
- Tolerance: the tolerance used to calculate the direction of travel in metres
  (to filter out small GPS co-ordinate changes

Logging levels debug, info and error are in use

Example configuration.yaml entry:
proximity:
  zone: home
  ignored_zones:
    - twork
    - elschool
  devices:
    - device_tracker.nwaring_nickmobile
    - device_tracker.eleanorsiphone
    - device_tracker.tsiphone
  tolerance: 50
